## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a real-world hospital environment with separate dashboards and workflows for:

- Admin
- Doctor
- Patient

The system manages authentication, appointment booking, role-based access control, and structured backend APIs.

The goal of this project was to understand end-to-end application architecture — from backend API design to frontend integration and deployment.
